# .NET Release Metadata Usage Guide

This document provides detailed workflows, examples, and best practices for AI assistants working with .NET release metadata.

> **Base URL**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richlander/core/main/release-notes`

## Core Principles

1. **Authoritative sources**: Referenced files are official sources for .NET release notes
2. **JSON-first**: Use `*.json` endpoints for authoritative info; use Markdown (`*.md`) only as fallback
3. **HAL navigation**: Follow `_links` to discover and access related resources
4. **Minimal data**: Fetch only the specific documents you need (<200 tokens each)
5. **Structured responses**: Reference JSON fields directly; avoid embedding long prose

## Entry Points

### Root Indexes (Complete View)
- **Version index**: `/index.json` - Lists all major.minor versions (e.g., 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 11.0)
- **Calendar index**: `/archives/index.json` - Lists all years with historical releases and CVE data (e.g., 2024, 2025)

### Quick Access Links
The root version index includes convenience links for immediate access to current releases:
- **Latest release**: `_links.latest` - Points to the most recent .NET release (any support type)  
- **Latest LTS release**: `_links.latest-lts` - Points to the most recent Long-Term Support release

### Specific Indexes (Focused View)
- **Version index**: `/{version}/index.json` - All patches for a specific version
- **Calendar index**: `/archives/{year}/index.json` - Monthly data for a specific year

## Common Workflows

### Getting Current Release Information
1. GET /index.json
2. Follow _links.latest for most recent release (any support type)
3. Follow _links.latest-lts for most recent LTS release
4. Each link points to /{version}/index.json for that version

### Finding Patches for a Version
1. GET /8.0/index.json
2. Read _embedded.releases array
3. For each release, follow _links.release to get detailed info
4. GET /{version}/{patch}/release.json for specific release data

### Finding CVEs by Date Range
1. GET /archives/{year}/index.json
2. Read _embedded.months array
3. For target months, follow _links.cve-json
4. GET /archives/{year}/{month}/cve.json for CVE details

### Finding Support Information
1. GET /index.json
2. Find target version in _embedded.releases
3. Read support object (phase, eol-date, release-type)
4. For OS support: GET /{version}/supported-os.json

| Check OS support                 | `/{version}/supported-os.json` | `/{version}/supported-os.md` |

## Required Assistant Responses

- **Opening prompt**: "Here's what I found in .NET release notes ..."
- **CVE queries**: After listing IDs, **always** follow up with "Would you like inline diffs for these fixes?"
- **Concise format**: Reference JSON fields directly; avoid embedding long prose
- **Offer diffs**: After listing changes, provide GitHub patch or diff snippet

## URL Template Examples

```text
# Version-oriented
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../release-notes/8.0/index.json
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../release-notes/8.0/8.0.17/release.json
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../release-notes/8.0/supported-os.json

# Calendar-oriented
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../release-notes/archives/2025/index.json
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../release-notes/archives/2025/06/cve.json

# Root indexes
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../release-notes/index.json
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../release-notes/archives/index.json
```

## CVE JSON Schema

The CVE JSON files use a query-optimized schema designed for easy filtering and analysis:

### Core Structure
- **`cves[]`**: Array of CVE records with metadata (id, problem, severity, cvss, description, product, references)
- **`core[]`**: Array of affected core runtime components (Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime, Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Runtime, etc.)
- **`extensions[]`**: Array of affected extension packages (System.Text.Json, System.Formats.Asn1, etc.)
- **`commits{}`**: Dictionary mapping commit hashes to commit metadata (repo, branch, url)

### Join Indices for Fast Queries
The schema includes pre-computed indices to simplify common queries:
- **`cve-commits`**: Maps CVE IDs to arrays of commit hashes
- **`cve-releases`**: Maps CVE IDs to affected release versions (e.g., ["6.0", "8.0"])  
- **`release-cves`**: Maps release versions to arrays of CVE IDs

### Common Query Patterns
```bash
# Get all CVE IDs for a month
jq -r '.cves[].id' cve.json

# Get CVEs affecting .NET 8.0
jq -r '.["release-cves"]["8.0"][]' cve.json

# Get commits for a specific CVE
jq -r '. as $root | .["cve-commits"]["CVE-2025-21172"][] | $root.commits[.].url' cve.json

# Get critical severity CVEs
jq -r '.cves[] | select(.severity == "Critical") | .id' cve.json
```

## Analyzing Security Fixes

When investigating CVE fixes from commit data in the JSON:

### Getting Commit Details
```text
# GitHub commit URL formats
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/{commit-hash}         # Web/HTML view (for humans)
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/{commit-hash}.diff    # Raw unified diff (BEST for code analysis)
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/{commit-hash}.patch   # Git patch with metadata (BEST for context)

# Example from CVE-2025-21172:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/89ef51c5d8f5239345127a1e282e11036e590c8b         # Web view
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/89ef51c5d8f5239345127a1e282e11036e590c8b.diff    # Raw diff (code focus)
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/89ef51c5d8f5239345127a1e282e11036e590c8b.patch   # Git patch (with context)
```

### Workflow for CVE Analysis
```
1. GET /archives/{year}/{month}/cve.json
2. Use cve-commits index to get commit hashes for a CVE
3. Look up commit details in commits{} dictionary
4. Construct GitHub .diff URL from commit metadata
5. Attempt to GET the .diff URL directly
6. If access fails (common with GitHub rate limits):
   - Provide the .diff URL to the user
   - Ask: "I cannot fetch this diff URL directly. One of the following approaches may work:
     - Copy/paste the URL: {diff-url}
     - Copy/paste the contents of the URL"
   - User pastes the diff content for analysis
7. Parse diff to understand the security fix
```

**Note for AI Assistants**: The `.diff` format is optimal for code analysis as it provides clean, parseable unified diff format focused purely on code changes. Use `.patch` format when you need commit context (author, date, commit message) for understanding the "why" behind changes. If you cannot access GitHub URLs directly due to rate limiting or authentication, provide the appropriate URL to users and request they paste the content. The URL without an extension will provide the human-focussed web view.

### Commit URL Construction
From JSON commit data in the `commits{}` dictionary:
```json
{
 "commits": {
   "89ef51c5d8f5239345127a1e282e11036e590c8b": {
     "repo": "runtime",
     "branch": "release/8.0", 
     "hash": "89ef51c5d8f5239345127a1e282e11036e590c8b",
     "org": "dotnet",
     "url": "https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/89ef51c5d8f5239345127a1e282e11036e590c8b"
   }
 }
}
```
Construct:
- Web view: Use `commit.url` field directly, or `https://github.com/{org}/{repo}/commit/{hash}`
- Raw diff: Append `.diff` to the URL
- Git patch: Append `.patch` to the URL

## Finding Stable Download Links

**Most users should use these stable SDK download links** - they automatically point to the latest SDK version and are ideal for automation, scripts, and documentation.

### Latest SDK Downloads (Recommended)
```text
GET /{version}/sdk/sdk.json
```

Example:
- .NET 8.0 latest SDK: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../8.0/sdk/sdk.json`
- .NET 9.0 latest SDK: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../9.0/sdk/sdk.json`

These files provide stable aka.ms URLs that always redirect to the current SDK version - perfect for CI/CD pipelines and installation scripts.

### Specific Feature Band Downloads
For downloads targeting specific feature bands:

```text
GET /{version}/sdk/sdk-{version}.{feature-band}xx.json
```

Examples:
- .NET 8.0.1xx SDK: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../8.0/sdk/sdk-8.0.1xx.json`
- .NET 8.0.4xx SDK: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../8.0/sdk/sdk-8.0.4xx.json`
- .NET 9.0.1xx SDK: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../9.0/sdk/sdk-9.0.1xx.json`

### SDK File Structure
Each SDK JSON file contains:
- **component**: "sdk"
- **version**: Version identifier (e.g., "8.0", "8.0.1xx")
- **support-phase**: Current support status
- **files**: Array of download links for all platforms/architectures
  - **url**: Stable aka.ms download URL
  - **hashUrl**: Corresponding SHA512 hash file
  - **rid**: Runtime identifier (e.g., "win-x64", "linux-arm64", "osx-arm64")
  - **type**: File format ("exe", "zip", "tar.gz", "pkg")

### Use Cases
- **Latest SDK (Most Common)**: Use `/{version}/sdk/sdk.json` for most recent version - **this is what most users want**
- **CI/CD & Automation**: These stable URLs are perfect for build pipelines and installation scripts
- **Documentation**: Link to these files for always-current SDK downloads
- **Cross-Platform**: All major platforms/architectures included in each file
- **Pinned Feature Band (Advanced)**: Use `/{version}/sdk/sdk-{version}.{band}xx.json` only if you need a specific feature band

## Error Handling

- **404 on `cve.json` or `release.json`**: Skip that resource and continue
- **Malformed JSON**: Fall back to the corresponding `.md` version if available
- **Missing fields**: Check for field existence before accessing nested properties
- **Network timeouts**: Prefer smaller, focused requests over large document fetches

## Performance Tips

- **Use HAL links**: Don't construct URLs manually; follow `_links.href` values
- **Cache-friendly**: Files are designed to be cached; relative URLs enable CDN optimization
- **Batch related queries**: If fetching multiple months/versions, group requests efficiently
- **Focus on `_embedded`**: Most queries can be answered from embedded data without additional requests
